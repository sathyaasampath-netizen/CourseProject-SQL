It simulates real-world operations such as customer orders, restaurants, couriers, payments, and delivery performance. The project highlights strong SQL skills in database design, data management, and analytics for business insights.
## 📊 Project Overview
FoodExpressDB is a relational database system designed for a food delivery business. It simulates real-world operations such as customer orders, restaurants, couriers, payments, and delivery performance. The project highlights strong SQL skills in database design, data management, and analytics for business insights.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Database Design**: Built a normalized schema with 12+ interrelated tables covering customers, restaurants, couriers, orders, menus, payments, and ratings.  
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Implemented primary/foreign keys, constraints, indexes, and views for efficient queries.  
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Inserted 200+ realistic records across all tables to mimic real-world food delivery transactions.  
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**:  
  - Top 10 customers by total spend.  
  - Restaurant revenue vs. average ratings.  
  - Delivery performance (time taken, courier efficiency).  
- **Advanced SQL**: Developed stored procedures, triggers, and transactions to handle business rules (e.g., auto-updating order status, validating payments).  
- **Analytics Integration**: Created materialized views for machine learning use cases like customer retention and delivery optimization.  

## 📈 Example Use Cases
- Identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.  
- Analyze courier performance and delivery delays.  
- Compare restaurant quality based on revenue and customer ratings.  
- Build ML-ready datasets for retention and demand forecasting.  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL Workbench 8.0+  
- ERD modeling (draw.io)  
- Python (pandas + matplotlib for visualization)  

## 🚀 Key Learning
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a complex SQL database, perform advanced analytics queries, and prepare structured datasets for business intelligence and predictive modeling.
